    For this assignment, we were given files from the professor. You are set out to understand the code given and proceed to implement classes/interfaces that will further enhance the program. This program gives the actions of Hockey Players, depending on their position, during a game.

2. Assignment 2: Observer
    For this assignment, we were given a UML and a driver file from the professor. We then need to implement a program that correctly utilizes the UML using classes/interfaces that we will create.
