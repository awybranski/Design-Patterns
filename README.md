Design Patterns Assignments for CSCE 247
    
1. Assignment 1: Strategy - 
    For this assignment, we were given files from the professor. You are set out to understand the code given and proceed to implement classes/interfaces that will further enhance the program. This program gives the actions of Hockey Players, depending on their position, during a game.

2. Assignment 2: Observer - 
    For this assignment, we were given a UML and a driver file from the professor. We then need to implement a program that correctly utilizes the UML using classes/interfaces that we will create. This program behaves in a subject/observer way. It focuses on two groups, the police and the cartel, observing what the cook is doing. they are keeping notes on his locations, behaviors, and accomplices. 

3. Assignment 3: Decorator - 
    For this assignment, we were given files and a UML file from the professor. We are told to implement a program that correctly utilizes the UML by creating necessary classes. This program decorates an image of a warrior that is read in from a text file. To decorate the image you have to read in the decorating files, armor, shield, and/or, sword, and overlay it over the already existing warrior image. 

4. Assignment 4: State - 
    For this assignment, we were given a driver file, file reader class, text files, and a UML diagram. We were told to implement a program that correctly moves throughout the states of the system based on the user's input. From what the user inputs, the program will read through a grade level's spellingList and store the information in an ArrayList. It will then randomly grab words from the list and print them to the console. The user can also change states, move from first to second to third grade and back down. It, however, does not go past or below those grades.
